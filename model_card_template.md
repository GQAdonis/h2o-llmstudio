# Model Card
## Summary

This model was trained using [H2O LLM Studio](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio).
- Base model: [{{base_model}}](https://huggingface.co/{{base_model}})


## Usage

To use the model with the `transformers` library on a machine with GPUs, first make sure you have the `transformers` and `accelerate` libraries installed.

```bash
pip install transformers==4.28.1
pip install accelerate==0.18.0
```

```python
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

generate_text = pipeline(model="{{repo_id}}", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, trust_remote_code=True, device_map="auto")

res = generate_text("Why is drinking water so healthy?", max_new_tokens=100)
print(res[0]["generated_text"])
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to not use `trust_remote_code=True` you can download [h2oai_pipeline.py](https://huggingface.co/{{repo_id}}/blob/main/h2oai_pipeline.py), store it alongside your notebook, and construct the pipeline yourself from the loaded model and tokenizer:

```python
import torch
from h2oai_pipeline import H2OTextGenerationPipeline
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("{{repo_id}}", padding_side="left")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("{{repo_id}}", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
generate_text = H2OTextGenerationPipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

res = generate_text("Why is drinking water so healthy?", max_new_tokens=100)
print(res[0]["generated_text"])
```

## Model Configuration

This model was trained using H2O LLM Studio and with the configuration in [cfg.yaml](cfg.yaml). Visit [H2O LLM Studio](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio) to learn how to train your own large language models.


## Model Validation

Model validation results using [EleutherAI lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --model hf-causal-experimental --model_args pretrained={{repo_id}} --tasks openbookqa,arc_easy,winogrande,hellaswag,arc_challenge,piqa,boolq --device cuda &> eval.log
